	<description>This mod makes it so that colonists and prisoners with the Night Owl trait will have an alternative initial schedule to avoid working during the day and suffering -10 mood as a result.

Regular Colonists: sleep at 0-5 and 22-23

Night Owls: sleep at 11-18

This mod only changes the initial schedule upon pawn generation; existing Night Owls will NOT have their schedule changed.

Incompatibility: None
Old Save Compatible: Yes
